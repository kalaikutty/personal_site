            <p>A Web application that makes use of deep-learning based Facial Detection and Emotion detection
              techniques to identify a person's Emotion and stream/recommend songs to the person. </p>
            <p>Data wrangling is performed on raw data from the Spotify API and genre classification is achieved using

            <h3>Telegram Bot for Food ordering using AWS</h3>
            <p>I created a Telegram bot that facilitated food orders and chef notifications using AWS services such as API Gateway, DynamoDB, Lambda functions, and Simple Notification Service (SNS). The bot was designed for seamless user interactions, with AWS API Gateway handling API requests and backend communication. Order data was securely stored in DynamoDB, ensuring scalability and reliability.</p>

            <p>AWS Lambda functions powered critical backend processes, enabling efficient order validation and placement. These serverless functions ensured rapid response times and flexibility for varying user loads. Real-time notifications for chefs were implemented through AWS SNS, reducing order processing times and enhancing user experience.</p>

              <h3>Fingerprint based Door Lock mechanism</h3>
              <p>I successfully executed an IoT-based project, which involved collecting a user's fingerprint via a mobile application and transmitting it through a Bluetooth module to authenticate the opening of a door lock. This innovative system integrated mobile technology, IoT, and secure access control.</p>
              <p>The project's core functionality was achieved through the mobile application, where users registered their fingerprints. When they approached the door lock, the mobile app seamlessly communicated with a Bluetooth module, which transmitted the fingerprint data for verification. This method provided a secure and convenient access control solution, enhancing user experience and safety.</p>
